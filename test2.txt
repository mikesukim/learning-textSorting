Chelsea captain John Terry will leave the club at the end of the season after more than two decades there.

He is their most decorated individual, with four Premier League titles, one Champions League, five FA Cups, a Europa League and three League Cups.

He has made 713 Chelsea appearances since his 1998 debut - 578 as captain.

"I feel I still have plenty to offer on the pitch but understand that opportunities here at Chelsea will be limited for me," Terry, 36, said.

Centre-back Terry, who has scored 66 goals for the club he joined as a 14-year-old, has made just four Premier League starts this season.

He is the club's third highest all-time appearance maker, behind Ron Harris and Peter Bonetti, and holds the club record for appearances as captain. thank you.
